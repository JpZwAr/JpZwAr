- 👋 Hi, I’m @JpZwAr
- 👀 I’m interested in Information Security and Web Development.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about JavaScript, Node.js, Next.js and React, with the goal to become a Fullstack Developer.
- 💻 I have some amount of practice with Linux and Information Security Tools (Wireshark, TCPDump and so on).
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that can give me a more deeper understanding about the topics of my interest.
